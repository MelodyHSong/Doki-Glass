## ☆ The Request
**What new trick should Doki-Glass learn?**
(A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see added.)

## ☆ The Motivation
**Why is this upgrade needed?**
(Does this help with a specific workflow? Does it make the Windows 11 desktop feel even more seamless?)

## ☆ Proposed Behavior
**How should the glass behave?**
(Describe the interaction. Should it be a new hotkey, a specific entry in the `config.json`, or a new type of visual effect?)

## ☆ Additional Context
**Inspiration and Mockups**
(Add any screenshots, examples of other customization tools, or rough sketches of how the effect should look!)
