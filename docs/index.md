Welcome to the home of **Doki-Glass**, a boutique Windows 11 utility created by **MelodyHSong**. This tool is designed for developers, artists, and aesthetic enthusiasts who want a modern, see-through workspace without the heavy performance cost of traditional skinning suites.



## ☆ Quick Navigation

## ☆ Why Doki-Glass?

Windows 11 is beautiful, but some apps just don't want to join the "Glass" party. **Doki-Glass v1.2.0a** bridges that gap by using native Win32 API calls to inject transparency into your favorite tools—from **VS Code** to **Steam**.

### ✨ Highlights
* **Zero Bloat:** Built with Python and Win32.
* **Stable Hotkeys:** `Alt + PageUp` to toggle, `Alt + PageDown` to hunt.
* **Admin Ready:** Native elevation ensures system windows are supported.


## ☆ The "Doki" Philosophy


Useful tools, very wow, much cute, very Doki~
